I’m Priya — a software engineer navigating the intersection of code, community, and collaboration.

My day-to-day profession includes developing the Django backend APIs, automating deployment workflows, handling infra and system reliability at a fintech startup [BeyondIRR](https://www.beyondirr.com); alias [GitHub Work Account](https://github.com/priyapahwa19).
 
I’m passionate about Django and committed to contributing back to the vibrant community of the technology I rely on for work every day. I love volunteering at the [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space) as a Session Organizer and Fundraising Working Group of the Django Software Foundation.

I am also a GitHub Campus Expert and GitHub Octern ‘23 (SWE Django), often found in a red hoodie organizing hackathons, field days, or technical workshops. 

When I’m not debugging code or setting up infrastructure, I’m sketching Bob Ross landscapes or translating Van Gogh impressionism into life tales.
