I am a software engineer building backend systems and the infrastructure around them at a fintech startup.

Most of my work lives in Django and Python, with AWS and CircleCI handling the operational choreography. I care about writing code that is explicit about its assumptions, cool yet sensible automations, clear trust boundaries, services that are stable by design, releases that move smoothly, infra alerts that stay quietly managed, and deployments that don’t require theatrics. 

_Although, every now and then, a slightly dramatic rollout keeps things humbling. Perhaps, a learning opportunity in hindsight._

To follow trends per se, I’ve been exploring the AI world, not as a novelty, but as a systems problem. I’m interested in what genuinely improves developer productivity, what meaningfully augments thinking, and what simply adds noise.
